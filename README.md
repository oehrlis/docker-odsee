### Environment Variable and Directories
The following environment variable have been used for the installation. In particular it is possible to modify the variables ORACLE_ROOT, ORACLE_DATA and ORACLE_BASE via *build-arg* during image build to have a different directory structure. All other parameters are only relevant for the creation of the container. They may be modify via `docker run` environment variables.

### Scripts to Build and Setup
The following scripts are used either during Docker image build or while setting up and starting the container.

| Script                    | Purpose
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `build.sh`                 | Build helper script for docker ODSEE image
| `check_ODSEE_Instance.sh`   | Check the status of the ODSEE instance for Docker HEALTHCHECK
| `config_ODSEE_Instance.sh`  | Configure ODSEE instance using custom scripts
| `create_ODSEE_Instance.sh`  | Script to create the ODSEE instance
| `setup_ODSEE.sh`           | Setup script for the ODSEE environment when creating Docker images
| `start_ODSEE_Instance.sh`   | Script to start the ODSEE domain

## Installation and build
The docker image can be build manually based on [oehrlis/docker-odsee](https://github.com/oehrlis/docker-oudbase) from GitHub To assist in building the images, you can use the [buildDockerImage.sh](scripts/build.sh) script. See below for instructions and usage. The `build.sh` script is just a utility shell script to setup the `docker build` command and is an easy way for beginners to get started. Expert users are welcome to directly call `docker build` with their preferred set of parameters.

Due to license restrictions from Oracle, the Docker images can not provided on a public Docker repository (see [OTN Developer License Terms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/standard-license-152015.html)). The required Software has to be downloaded prior image build. Alternatively it is possible to specify MOS credentials in `scripts/.netrc` or via build arguments. Using MOS download during image build will lead into smaller images, since the software will not be part of an intermediate intermediate container.

### Obtaining Product Distributions
The Oracle Software required to setup an Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition Docker image is basically not public available. It is subject to Oracle's license terms. For this reason a valid license is required (eg. [OTN Developer License Terms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/standard-license-152015.html)). In addition, Oracle's license terms and conditions must be accepted before downloading.

The following software is required for the Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition image:
* Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition 11.1.1.7.0. Alternatively you may use the latest patch release via MOS Patch ID [26724938](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=26724938)

The software can either be downloaded from [My Oracle Support (MOS)](https://support.oracle.com), [Oracle Technology Network (OTN)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/index.html) or [Oracle Software Delivery Cloud (OSDC)](http://edelivery.oracle.com). The following steps will refer to the MOS software download to simplify the build process.

### Manual Download Software
Currently there is no installation method provided for Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition. Therefore the software has to be manually extracted into the Docker build context in the folder `software`. It will then be added to the container at build time.

        cd /tmp
        unzip p26724938_111170_Linux-x86-64.zip
        tar zxvf dsee.11.1.1.7.171017.Redhat5-opt-64.full.zip.tar.gz
        cp sun-dsee7.zip <BUILD CONTEXT>/software/ 
        cd <BUILD CONTEXT>/software/ 
        unzip sun-dsee7.zip
        rm sun-dsee7.zip
        
        optional slim down dsee7/jre

* Manual build the image based on the source from GitHub ([oehrlis/docker-odsee](https://github.com/oehrlis/docker-odsee)).

        docker build -t oehrlis/odsee .

* Create a new named container and run it interactive (-i -t)

        docker run -v [<host mount point>:]/u01 -P -h odsee --name odsee oehrlis/odsee

## Running the Docker Images
### Setup an Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition Container
Creating a ODSEE container is straight forward with **docker run** command. The script `start_ODSEE_Instance.sh` will make sure, that a new ODSEE instance is created, when the container is started the first time.  The instance is created using predefined values. (see below). If an ODSEE instance already exists, the script simply starts it.

The creation of the ODSEE instance can be influenced by the following environment variables. You only have to set them with option -e when executing "docker run":

* **ADMIN_PASSWORD** ODSEE admin password (default *autogenerated*)
* **ADMIN_USER**  OUD admin user name (default *cn=Directory Manager*)
* **BASEDN** Directory base DN (default *dc=postgasse,dc=org*)
* **LDAPS_PORT** SSL LDAP port (default *1636*)
* **LDAP_PORT** Regular LDAP port (default *1389*)
* **ODSEE_INSTANCE** OUD instance name (default *oud_docker*)
* **ODSEE_INSTANCE_HOME** OUD home path (default */u01/instances/oud_docker*)
* **ODSEE_INSTANCE_INIT** default folder for OUD instance init scripts. These scripts are used to modify and adjust the new OUD instance.

Run your Oracle Unified Directory Docker image use the **docker run** command as follows:

    docker run --name odsee <container name> \
    --hostname <container hostname> -P \
    -e OUD_INSTANCE=<your odsee instance name> \
    --volume [<host mount point>:]/u01 \
    --volume [<host mount point>:]/u01/scripts \
    oehrlis/odsee

    Parameters:
    --name:           The name of the container (default: auto generated)
    -p:               The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
                      for ports are exposed: 1389 (LDAP), 1636 (LDAPS), 4444 (Admin Port), 8989 (Replication Port)
    -P:               Map all exposed ports
    -e ODSEE_INSTANCE: The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDB_ADMIN password (default: auto generated)
    -e <Variables>   Other environment variable according "Environment Variable and Directories"
    -v /u01
                  The data volume to use for the OUD instance.
                  Has to be writable by the Unix "oracle" (uid: 1000) user inside the container!
                  If omitted the OUD instance will not be persisted over container recreation.
    -v /u01/app/oracle/scripts | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
                  Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after OUD instance setup.
                  For further details see the "Running scripts after setup" section below.

There are four ports that are exposed in this image:
* 1389 which is the regular LDAP port to connect to the ODSEE instance.
* 1636 which is the SSL LDAP port to connect to the ODSEE instance.

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the ODSEE instance if not provided. You can find this password in the output line:
If you need to find the passwords at a later time, grep for "password" in the Docker logs generated during the startup of the container. To look at the Docker Container logs run:

    docker logs --details oud|grep -i password

#### Running Bash in a Docker container
Access your ODSEE container via bash.
    docker exec -u oracle -it oud bash --login

#### Running scripts after setup
The ODSEE Docker image can be configured to run scripts after setup. Currently `sh` and `ldif` extensions are supported. For post-setup scripts just create a folder `scripts/setup` in generic volume `/u01`, mount a dedicated volume `/u01/scripts/setup` or extend the image to include scripts in this directory. The location is also represented under the symbolic link `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. This is done to provide synergy with other Docker images. The user is free to decide whether he wants to put his setup scripts under `/u01/scripts/setup` or `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

After the ODSEE instance is setup the scripts in those folders will be executed against the instance in the container. LDIF files (`ldif`) will be loaded using `ldapmodify` as *cn=Directory Manager* (ADMIN_USER). Shell scripts will be executed as the current user (oracle). To ensure proper order it is recommended to prefix your scripts with a number. For example `01_instance.sh`, `02_schema_extention.ldif`, etc.
